Multiple Linear Regression

############### LINEAR REGRESSION #################

###### Problem Statement: 
###    Predict student performance in secondary education (high school) for final grade scores.

# Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning we'll have labeled data and try to predict new labels on unlabeled data. 
 
# We'll explore some of the following concepts:
  
# Get our Data
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Clean our Data
# Review of Model Form
# Train and Test Groups
# Linear Regression Model

###### Getting our Data ######

# We will use the Student Performance Data Set from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository!
